# Turtle Crossing Game

## Description

Welcome to Turtle Crossing! This is a simple arcade-style game where you control a turtle that needs to cross the road 
from the bottom of the screen to the top. Meanwhile, cars are moving from left to right, and your goal is to avoid 
hit by any of the cars (Rectangle Bar). The game ends when a car collides with the turtle, but if you successfully cross to the top, 
your crossing speed increases, making the game more challenging and exciting.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow Up key to control the turtle's movement.
2. Avoid colliding with the cars moving across the screen from left to right.
3. If a car hits the turtle, the game ends, and you have to start again from the beginning.
4. Once the turtle successfully reaches the top end of the screen, it will return to the starting point, and 
the crossing speed will increase (Level UP).
5. The game continues until you are unable to avoid a collision or choose to quit.

## Controls

## Scoring
